## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A local web server capable of running PHP (e.g., **XAMPP**, **WAMP**, **MAMP**, or a native `php -S` server).

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/swarajchikhale/Fitness-Station.git
   ```

2. **Move or open the project**  
   Place it into your server's root directory (e.g., `htdocs` for XAMPP), or run a local PHP server:
   ```bash
   php -S localhost:8000
   ```

3. **Access the site**  
   Navigate to `http://localhost/` or `http://localhost:8000/index.html`.

### Usage Flow

- Visit the **Home Page** (`index.html`), likely with workout content or a welcome interface.
- Navigate to **register** to create an account (via `register.php`).
- **Login** with your credentials (via `login.php`).
- If errors occur, you'll see feedback via `invalid.html` or `wrong.html`.
